							<h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>
						</div>
						<a class="anchor" name="teaching-statement"></a>
						
						<p style="color:red">To structure and update with CTL examples.</p>
							
						<p> In large STEM classes, it's tempting to slip into lecture-style instruction. Lecture is often a critical component of proof-based classes. However, unless we determine which teaching goals are better supported by active or interactive learning, we rob students of the potential of in-person instruction. My teaching strategy requires careful attention to which learning objectives are best achieved in the classroom and which can be effectively achieved outside it. </p>
							
						<p> To make these decisions, I build on best practices from existing teaching literature (Flipping the College Classroom, What the Best College Teachers Do). Often, firm best practices are well-established in humanities disciplines: for example, paradigms such as Active Learning (Cite) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) (Cite) are often tailored to seminar-style classes in which prose writing and discussion are already the primary means of interaction. It has been challenging and rewarding to adapt these practices to proof-based computer science theory classes. </p>
							
						<p> In practice, I've settled on what I call a "semi-flipped" teaching model. A significant fraction of a typical class still consists of lecture, but this is broken up and interwoven with interactive activities, animations and videos, student-led proof activities, individual or small-group puzzles, and classroom assessment techniques (Cite). Homework remains centered on problem sets, but each problem is scaffolded by my three R's: Rationale, References, and Rubric (see <a href="materials.html">Course Materials</a>). Outside of class, students might also brush up on tough concepts using the lightning review and example videos that I post to YouTube or put together a targeted study plan using the comprehensive Course Skeleton to get a bird's-eye view of what we've recently learned. The many ways to engage and express mastery are by design, in accordance with UDL.</p>
							
						<p> Because I want to offer students multiple modes of engagement, I recognize that organization and structure are critical. After class, students know when they can expect problem sets, lecture notes, review videos and the course skeleton will be posted, as well as when homework will be due. I try to decrease uncertainty as much as possible: ideally, my students always know what is expected of them and where to go for help (see <a href="feedback.html">Student Feedback</a> on organization). </p>
							
						<p> Finally, my teaching style offers warmth and compassion and is predicated on mutual trust. Outside the classroom, I spend much of my energy on student interaction, aiming for 4-6 office hours per week, and on intervention at critical points. I work hard to keep up with students' performance on graded work and catch difficulties before they evolve into major problems. If a student struggles with a problem set or a certain topic, they recieve an email from me outlining the ways they can bounce back and succeed. I want my students to feel seen and valued, so I also reach out when students demonstrate hard work and improvement (see <a href="feedback.html">Student Feedback</a> on support and approachability).</p>

							<h2> Commitment to Equity </h2>
						</div>
						
						<p style="color:red">To structure and update with CTL examples.</p>
						
						<p> A teacher's first job is to develop ability, awareness, and confidence in all of their students so that they can succeed and do good in the world. Thus teaching and promoting equity are inseparable goals. Like most of my professional peers, I inhabit the intersection of several privileged identity categories and inherit the responsibility to self-educate and work proactively to dismantle the system of structural inequity in computer science.
						<p> 
						
						<p> In my classroom, I pursue this mission by working to build a universally accessible curriculum (see <a href="overview.html#teaching-statement">Teaching Philosophy</a>) and reducing inequity due to grades (Cite Grading for Equity, UnGrading). In practice, this means maintaining high standards while ensuring all students have a path to meet them. It also means narrowing the scope of grades to students' demonstrated ability to meet learning objectives at the end of the course, and excluding subjective standards of behavior that descend from the factory model of learning such as attendance, participation, and strict deadline adherence. This is not as simple as universal leniency: instead, it requires an ongoing effort to balance strong incentives to learn with student dignity and autonomy.
						</p>
						
						<p> I work to make the university context outside my classroom reflect the standards I try to set inside it. This includes supporting students through volunteering and mentorship programs, ensuring a democratic voice for students and student workers, pursuing equity in admissions, and participating in computer science outreach to incoming students and potential students beyond the university.

								<p> Mathematics teaches us to ask questions like "What is the value of f(x)?", "Do any objects of type Y exist?", and "Is Z true?" Theoretical computer science builds on this tradition, expanding our field of inquiry to include questions like "How much time (and other limited resources) does it take to evaluate f(x)?", "Can I write down formal instructions for finding a Y?", and "Can the truth of Z be computed?" In theoretical computer science, we define problems formally and think about how hard they are to solve under various models of computation.</p>
