My goal is that your grade in the course accurately reflects what you know and can do by the end of the course. There are severalÂ questions on the final that overlap from material with homework 4. I don't yet have complete grades for the final, but if you'd like, I can do the following:
 - For Problem 1: Problem 1 overlaps with problem 2 on the final. If you'd like, I can count the % grade of problem 2 on the final as your grade on problem 1 of HW4. Alternatively, I can give you a make-up question for 2/3 credit.
 - For Problem 2: Problem 2 is similar to problem 3 on the final. If you'd like, I can count the % grade of Problem 3 on the final as your grade on problem 2 of HW4. Alternatively, I can give you a make-up question for 2/3 credit.
 - For Problem 3: I can give you a make-up question for 2/3 credit.
 - For Problem 4: Problem 4 is similar to problem 4 on the final. If you'd like, I can count the % grade of problem 4 on the final as your grade on problem 4 of HW4.
 
 All my best, and happy fourth of July weekend!
